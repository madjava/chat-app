Chap App
===

A simple chat app with very basic funtionality for demos purposes.

## Install

Its a simple NodeJs application so after cloning the repo run
```javascript
  npm install
```

You can also view a [live version](https://felix-chat-app.herokuapp.com) hosted on Heroku. 

To have a play:
- Open the URL in two seperate browsers
- In browser 1, Create a new Chat room by joining with a `Display name` and a `Room` name
- In the other browser, join the same `Room` but with a different `Display name`

Have fun! ðŸ™‚.
